Finally, I have a blog set up.

Hello World

I decided to use Jekyll and Github pages to host this blog. It's very easy and mostly automated, and it allows me to focus on the content, rather than the hosting and layout particulars. I've created a simple theme for that reason. I definitely recommend checking out [**barryclark/jekyll-now**](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to get started if you're interested in doing the same.
